# Runn Sync Project

This project was created because our company wanted a sync algorithm, that is more sophisticated than existing solutions.

## Runn Personio sync

We use personio.de as our HR tool. One part of the sync is there to sync absences from personio to runn.

Currently the algorithm deletes all existing leave times, this is only until runn will allow to "overwrite" existing leave times
